# swift-concurrency

Concurrency is a general programming concept. It gives our program the ability to execute multiple tasks and the same time for example fetching data and updating the UI.
This allows for our application to be responsive efficient scalable and allows for optimise resource usage.


### The Do, Try, Catch Statment

The new try catch statement or system is used heavily with swift concurrency specially an error handling. 
When you define a function that is throwing you must call it using try and catch.

Functions that are triers can catch errors that are thrown and handle them.

It's robust way to error handling.

Hint: try! We should never force try.
